# Heart_disease__ML_project
This project trains and evaluates ML models for heart disease prediction. It covers data preprocessing, train-test splitting, scratch and scikit-learn model implementations, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance.
